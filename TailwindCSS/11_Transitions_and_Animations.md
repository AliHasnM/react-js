## **11. Transitions & Animations**

### **Transition Property**

- **`transition-none`**: Disables all transition effects for the element.
- **`transition-all`**: Applies transition effects to all properties of the element that can be transitioned.
- **`transition`**: Applies a default transition effect for properties (equivalent to `transition-all`).
- **`transition-colors`**: Applies transition effects specifically to color-related properties (like background color, text color, etc.).
- **`transition-opacity`**: Applies transition effects specifically to the opacity property.

### **Duration**

- **`duration-75`**: Sets the duration of the transition to 75 milliseconds.
- **`duration-100`**: Sets the duration of the transition to 100 milliseconds.
- **`duration-150`**: Sets the duration of the transition to 150 milliseconds.
- **`duration-200`**: Sets the duration of the transition to 200 milliseconds.
- **`duration-300`**: Sets the duration of the transition to 300 milliseconds.
- **`duration-500`**: Sets the duration of the transition to 500 milliseconds.
- **`duration-700`**: Sets the duration of the transition to 700 milliseconds.
- **`duration-1000`**: Sets the duration of the transition to 1000 milliseconds.

### **Timing Function**

- **`ease-linear`**: The transition has a constant speed from start to finish.
- **`ease-in`**: The transition starts slowly and speeds up towards the end.
- **`ease-out`**: The transition starts quickly and slows down towards the end.
- **`ease-in-out`**: The transition starts slowly, speeds up in the middle, and slows down at the end.

### **Delay**

- **`delay-75`**: Sets a delay of 75 milliseconds before the transition starts.
- **`delay-100`**: Sets a delay of 100 milliseconds before the transition starts.
- **`delay-150`**: Sets a delay of 150 milliseconds before the transition starts.
- **`delay-200`**: Sets a delay of 200 milliseconds before the transition starts.
- **`delay-300`**: Sets a delay of 300 milliseconds before the transition starts.
- **`delay-500`**: Sets a delay of 500 milliseconds before the transition starts.
- **`delay-700`**: Sets a delay of 700 milliseconds before the transition starts.
- **`delay-1000`**: Sets a delay of 1000 milliseconds before the transition starts.

### **Animation**

- **`animate-none`**: Disables all animations for the element.
- **`animate-spin`**: Applies a spinning animation to the element, rotating it continuously.
- **`animate-ping`**: Applies a pulsating animation, where the element scales up and down to create a ping effect.
- **`animate-pulse`**: Applies a gentle pulsing animation, where the element gradually fades in and out.
- **`animate-bounce`**: Applies a bouncing animation to the element, making it move up and down.
