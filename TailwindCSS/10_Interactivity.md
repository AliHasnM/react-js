## **10. Interactivity**

### **Hover/Focus/Active States**

- **`hover:bg-blue-500`**: Changes the background color to blue when the element is hovered over, enhancing the interactive experience.
- **`focus:bg-red-500`**: Changes the background color to red when the element is focused (e.g., through keyboard navigation), indicating that it is active or selected.
- **`active:bg-yellow-500`**: Changes the background color to yellow when the element is actively clicked, providing visual feedback during the click action.
- **`hover:underline`**: Adds an underline to the text when the element is hovered over, signaling that it is interactive (common for links).

### **Cursor**

- **`cursor-pointer`**: Changes the cursor to a pointer (hand icon) when hovering over the element, indicating that it is clickable (often used for buttons and links).
- **`cursor-default`**: Displays the default cursor, indicating that the element is not interactive.
- **`cursor-wait`**: Changes the cursor to a wait icon (hourglass) to indicate that a process is ongoing and the user should wait.
- **`cursor-move`**: Changes the cursor to a move icon (four arrows) to indicate that the element can be dragged or moved.
- **`cursor-not-allowed`**: Displays a not-allowed icon (circle with a line) to indicate that the element is disabled or not interactive.

### **Pointer Events**

- **`pointer-events-none`**: Disables all pointer events on the element, meaning it cannot be interacted with (e.g., clicks, hovers).
- **`pointer-events-auto`**: Restores the default pointer events, allowing the element to be interacted with normally.

---

### **Resize**

- **`resize`**: Allows the element to be resizable in both directions (horizontal and vertical).
- **`resize-x`**: Allows resizing only in the horizontal direction.
- **`resize-y`**: Allows resizing only in the vertical direction.
- **`resize-none`**: Disables resizing, keeping the element fixed in size.
